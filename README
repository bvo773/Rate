TASK
Create an interactive chart using Javscript, HTML, CSS and
the libraries jQuery and HighCharts.

STEPS
1. Convert the data.csv file into a valid JSON file. Use any
of the common CSV to JSON converters available online,
such as (http://www.csvjson.com/csv2json) and check it against
a validator (http://jsonlint.com/).

2. Modify js/main.js to build a chart using the HighCharts 
library. Here is a tutorial:
http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart

In addition to a highcharts object, make sure your final 
page has the following elements,  in the following order
from top to bottom::
     a. Headline
     b. Explainer 
     c. Highcharts chart
     d. Sourceline 
     e. Byline

You can create these elements either in the index.html file
or leave index.html untouched and add elements using jQuery
for extra style points.

If you're not familiar with the javascript console in 
your browser of choice, get familiar with it.

3. Modify css/style.css as necessary to style your chart.

You may want to use Bootstrap JS and CSS to start out with
prettier default elements:

And check your CSS against the CSS validator:
